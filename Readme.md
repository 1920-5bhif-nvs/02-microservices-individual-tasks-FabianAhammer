Premetheus is a visualization tool for Jakarte EE (former Java EE), it helps reading out large amounts of data by drawing different kinds of graphical illustrations.

There is also an inbuilt warning system, alerting the developer if some resources are getting overextended or if the server is on the brink of shutdown.

### Istio

When there are a lot of microservices present, which want to communicate to each other, one needs a tool to manage those coms, for such implementations Istio is a valid choice.

It has a lot of prebuild integrations on well known setups, like the Azure Cloud.

It also manages the security in these Network Mashes, and watches every little ping of the Nodes.
